Title: Design of High-Order Portfolios Including Skewness and Kurtosis
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2022-10-20
Description: The classical Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio formulation ignores 
    heavy tails and skewness. High-order portfolios use higher order moments to
    better characterize the return distribution. Different formulations and fast 
    algorithms are proposed for high-order portfolios based on the mean, variance, 
    skewness, and kurtosis.
    The package is based on the papers:
    R. Zhou and D. P. Palomar (2021). "Solving High-Order Portfolios via 
    Successive Convex Approximation Algorithms." <arXiv:2008.00863>.
    X. Wang, R. Zhou, J. Ying, and D. P. Palomar (2022). "Efficient and Scalable 
    High-Order Portfolios Design via Parametric Skew-t Distribution." <arXiv:2206.02412>.
